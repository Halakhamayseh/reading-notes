# Read: 16 - Spring Authentication

## Spring Security Architecture && Spring Auth Cheat Sheet

Authentication and Access Control

* Two problems of app security: authentication and authorization
* Authentication - Authentication Manager is the main strategy interface for authentication. In its authenticate() function, AuthenticationManager can accomplish one of three things: If it can verify that the input represents a genuine principal, it will return an Authentication. If it feels the input represents an invalid principal, it will throw an AuthenticationException. If it is unable to make a decision, it will return null. AuthenticationException is a runtime exception that is generally handled in a generic fashion by an application, depending on its style or purpose. Authentication Managers Can Be Customized The most popular configuration assistance provided by Spring Security is AuthenticationManagerBuilder, which allows you to easily set up basic authentication manager functionality in your application. AuthenticationManagerBuilder - supporting in-memory, JDBC, or LDAP user data, as well as creating a custom UserDetailsService

* Authorization or Access Control
* The AccessDecisionManager is the primary approach for authorization. The framework provides three implementations, each of which delegate to a chain of AccessDecisionVoter objects.
* An Authentication and a secure Object with ConfigAttributes are taken into account by AccessDecisionVoter.



## Web Security

Servlet Filters are used in the web layer of Spring Security. A single HTTP request client submits a request to the application, and the container determines which filters and servlets apply to it based on the path of the request URI. Filters create a chain, and the order in which they are applied is crucial, as a servlet can only handle one request at a time. If a filter wishes to handle the request directly, it can veto the remainder of the chain, and it can even change the request or response used by downstream filters and servlets. FilterChainProxy is the concrete kind of Spring Security, which is implemented as a single Filter in the chain. There are more filters within the single filter. Another layer of indirection in the security filter, DelegatingFilterProxy, which does not have to be a Spring @Bean, is generally deployed in the container as a DelegatingFilterProxy. There can be numerous filter chains, all of which are unknown to the container and are maintained by Spring Security in the same top-level FilterChainProxy.

## Method Security

As well as support for securing web applications, Spring Security offers support for applying access rules to Java method executions. For Spring Security, this is just a different type of “protected resource”. For users, it means the access rules are declared using the same format of ConfigAttribute strings (for example, roles or expressions) but in a different place in your code. The first step is to enable method security.


## Spring Auth Cheat Sheet

### Step 1: set up a user model and repo

### Step 2: create a controller for that model

### Step 3: UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService

- gets a User from the database by username (make sure your repository has the method to make this easy!)

### Step 4: ApplicationUser implements UserDetails

- use IntelliJ to implement the methods; make the boolean ones all return true

### Step 5: WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

- has a UserDetailsService
- passwordEncoder bean
- configure AuthManagerBuilder
- configure HttpSecurity
  - cors? csrf?
  - matchers for URLs that are allowed
    ensure that login and signup URLs allowed; also consider homepage etc.
  - formLogin with login page set up
  - logout

### Step 6: registration page

- create it w/ form
- ensure it posts to a route your controller is ready for
- check it's saving in the DB

### Step 7: login page

- create it w/ form
- ensure it posts to the route you specified in web config
- try it out!
- add to a template w/ things about the Principal
