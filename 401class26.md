# Read: 26 - Android Fundamentals

### Application Fundamentals

- Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK or an Android App Bundle.
- Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix, contains the contents of an Android app that are required at runtime and it is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.

### Each Android app lives in its own security sandbox, protected by the following Android security features:

- The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.

- By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.

- Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.

- By default, every app runs in its own Linux process. The Android system starts the process when any of the app's components need to be executed, and then shuts down the process when it's no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps.

## Intent

- An intent is created with an Intent object, which defines a message to activate either a specific component (explicit intent) or a specific type of component (implicit intent).
- For activities and services, an intent defines the action to perform.
- For broadcast receivers, the intent simply defines the announcement being broadcast.

## There are separate methods for activating each type of component:

- You can start an activity or give it something new to do by passing an Intent to startActivity() or startActivityForResult() (when you want the activity to return a result).
- With Android 5.0 (API level 21) and later, you can use the JobScheduler class to schedule actions. For earlier Android versions, you can start a service (or give new instructions to an ongoing service) by passing an Intent to startService(). You can bind to the service by passing an Intent to bindService().
- You can initiate a broadcast by passing an Intent to methods such as sendBroadcast(), sendOrderedBroadcast(), or sendStickyBroadcast().
- You can perform a query to a content provider by calling query() on a ContentResolver.

### App components: essential building blocks of an Android app.

- Activities:the entry point for interacting with the user.It represents a single screen with a user interface.
- Services:A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons.
- Broadcast receivers:is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements.
- Content providers:set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access.

### The manifest file
Before the Android system can start an app component, the system must know that the component exists by reading the app's manifest file, AndroidManifest.xml. Your app must declare all its components in this file, which must be at the root of the app project directory.

``` 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest ... >
    <application android:icon="@drawable/app_icon.png" ... >
        <activity android:name="com.example.project.ExampleActivity"
                  android:label="@string/example_label" ... >
        </activity>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest> 
```
