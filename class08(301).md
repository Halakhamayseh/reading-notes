## What Is SQL?
##### SQL: Structured Query Language

    * Designed to allow technical and non-technical users to query, manipulate, and transform data from a regional database

    * Provides storage for websites and mobile applications

    * Popular SQL databases include:

     * SQLite
     * MySQL
     * Postgres
     * Oracle
    * Microsoft SQL Server
   * All databases support common SQL language standard, though implementation in terms of features/storage types can differ between them

### SQL and Relational Databases
 * Relational database: A collection of related two-dimensional tables
    * Similar to an Excel spreadsheet: Fixed number of named columns (attributes/properties) + any number of rows of data
### SQL Functionality
   #### SELECT Statements (Queries)
        * SELECT Statements (also known as queries) allow us to retrieve data from a SQL database

           * Essentially:
             * Declares what data we're looking for,
             * Where to find it in the database,
             * How to transform it before it's returned (optional)
       * Think of a SQL table as an entity (i.e. Cars, Dogs)

         * Think of each table row as an instance of that type of thing (i.e. pug, beagle, lab)
         * Columns represent the common properties shared between all instances of that entity (i.e. color of fur, length of tail, etc.)
      * Most basic query would be selecting a few columns (properties) of a table with all rows (instances):

     * Alternatively, you could retrieve ALL columns of data using an asterisk (*)

       * This is especially useful as you can select a table and dump all of its data at once:

            SELECT *
            FROM mytable;
