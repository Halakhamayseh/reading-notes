# Read: 29 - Room

### Save data in a local database using Room.

Apps that handle non-trivial amounts of structured data can benefit greatly from persisting that data locally. The most common use case is to cache relevant pieces of data so that when the device cannot access the network, the user can still browse that content while they are offline.

The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. In particular, Room provides the following benefits:

1. Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
2. Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
3. Streamlined database migration paths.

### Primary components

There are three major components in Room:

- The *database* class that holds the database and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app's persisted data.
- *Data entities* that represent tables in your app's database.
- *Data access objects (DAOs)* that provide methods that your app can use to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database.

### Defining data using Room entities

#### Anatomy of an entity

- You define each Room entity as a class that is annotated with @Entity. A Room entity includes fields for each column in the corresponding table in the database, including one or more columns that comprise the primary key.

- By default, Room uses the class name as the database table name. If you want the table to have a different name, set the tableName property of the @Entity annotation. Similarly, Room uses the field names as column names in the database by default. If you want a column to have a different name, add the @ColumnInfo annotation to the field and set the name property. The following example demonstrates custom names for tables and columns:

#### Define a composite primary key

- If you need instances of an entity to be uniquely identified by a combination of multiple columns, you can define a composite primary key by listing those columns in the primaryKeys property of @Entity:

#### Ignore fields

- By default, Room creates a column for each field that's defined in the entity. If an entity has fields that you don't want to persist, you can annotate them using @Ignore.

#### Provide table search support
Room supports several types of annotations that make it easier for you to search for details in your database's tables.

#### Index specific columns
If your app must support SDK versions that don't allow for using FTS3- or FTS4-table-backed entities, you can still index certain columns in the database to speed up your queries. To add indices to an entity, include the indices property within the @Entity annotation, listing the names of the columns that you want to include in the index or composite inde

### Define relationships between objects

- A one-to-one relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of the parent entity corresponds to exactly one instance of the child entity, and vice-versa.

- A one-to-many relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of the parent entity corresponds to zero or more instances of the child entity.

- A many-to-many relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of the parent entity corresponds to zero or more instances of the child entity, and vice-versa.

### Accessing data using Room DAOs

- There are two types of DAO methods that define database interactions:

1. Convenience methods that let you insert, update, and delete rows in your database without writing any SQL code.
- Insert
The @Insert annotation allows you to define methods that insert their parameters into the appropriate table in the database.
- Update
The @Update annotation allows you to define methods that update specific rows in a database table
- Delete
The @Delete annotation allows you to define methods that delete specific rows from a database table

2. Query methods that let you write your own SQL query to interact with the database.

- Return a subset of a table's columns
Most of the time, you only need to return a subset of the columns from the table that you are querying
- Pass simple parameters to a query
Most of the time, your DAO methods need to accept parameters so that they can perform filtering operations
- Query multiple tables
Some of your queries might require access to multiple tables to calculate the result.
