## Reading 12: Components & EJS Partials
### EJS Partials
#### Partials are particularly useful when you'd like to reuse the same HTML across multiple views

* Think of partials like functions: They make larger websites easier to maintain (only have to change text in one place)
* Define reusable code in a file, and then just include it wherever it's needed
#### Basically, partials are an easy way to utilize reusable text

#### Partials are native to EJS (unlike layouts)

* Usage examples: Nav bar, footer, reusable piece of static text
* Syntax for partials: <%- body %> <%- include('partials/onepartial') %>
  * This tells EJS to look in a directory called "partials" (in the views folder), and will find a file called "onepartial"
### Partials Put to Use
#### Real-life example: You have the same nav bar and footer in both the home and post views of your site:

* Under views/partials/ directory, create new files navbar.ejs & footer.ejs
  * These files will contain only the HTML for the nav bar at the top and footer at bottom of both of those pages:
    <!-- views/partials/navbar.ejs -->
