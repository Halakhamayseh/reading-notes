# Read: 03 - Maps, primitives, File I/O

## primitives

- the most basic data types available within the Java language
- it is faster to access
- Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types
- Default values of the primitive types are 0 for numeric types, false for the boolean type, \u0000 for the char type.
## object 
- reference type are objects on the heap that are regarded somewhat slow to access, - whereas the primitive type variables in the stack are considered quite rapid to acquire. 
- The memory is affected by reference type variables Boolean – 128 bits, Byte – 128 bits.
- The usage of primitive types is preferred, however there are several limitations in contemporary Java that must be considered when deciding which type to employ.

## Maps

- It holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys.
- HashMap Methods
  - put(): To add items to it
  - get(): To access a value
  - remove(): To remove an item
  - clear(): To remove all items
  - size(): To find out how many items there are.

## Exceptions in Java

- An exception is an occurrence during the execution of a program that causes the program's regular flow to be disrupted. The call stack is a collection of methods that were called in order to find the method where the problem occurred. The block of code where the incident happened is known as an exception handler.
### Exceptions types:

1. _checked exception_: These are exceptional conditions that a well-written application should anticipate and recover from.
2. _the error_: These are exceptional conditions that are external to the application, and that the application usually cannot anticipate or recover from.
3. _the runtime exception_: These are exceptional conditions that are internal to the application, and that the application usually cannot anticipate or recover from.
## The Catch or Specify Requirement

A try statement that catches the exception or a handler for the exception must be wrapped in code that may throw specific exceptions. A method with a throws clause that specifies the exception.
## Scanning:

- Objects of type Scanner are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type.
- The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.

### To use scanner

* create an object of the class
* use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation.
