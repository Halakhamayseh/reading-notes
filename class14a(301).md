## Reading 14: Database Normalization
### Database Normalization Explained in Simple English
Key Concepts and Intro to Database Normalization
### Database Normalization: A process used to organize a database into tables and columns (redesigning the table)

### Key concepts:
Tables should be about specific topics
Only supporting topics should be included
This limits the table to one purpose and reduces duplicate data in your database
Helps cut down on issues stemming from database modifications
Three main reasons for database normalization:

### Minimize duplicate data
Minimize/avoid data modification issues
Simplify queries
Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies
Data duplication/duplicated information poses a problem because:
It increases storage and decreases performance
It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes
### Main Modification Anomalies:
* Insert Anomaly: Data that cannot be recorded until all other data for the entire row is also known (i.e., to create a record, we must have the primary key)

* Update Anomaly: If we do not update all the rows (especially with duplicate info), inconsistencies appear

* Deletion Anomaly: Row deletion can cause removal of more information than intended

* Search and Sort Issues: Separating data into different tables serving a single purpose means it's then easier to write queries (fewer columns to consider)

### Definitions of Database Normalization
Three common forms of database normalization

These forms are progressive (to qualify for the 2nd normal form, a table must satisfy the rules of the 1st normal form, etc.)
1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal forms are known as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, respectively
Key concept: There are three common rules for database normalization, and they depend upon each other

1. First Normal Form (1NF): The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of values.

2. Second Normal Form (2NF): The table is in first normal form, and all the columns depend on the table's primary key.

3. Third Normal Form (3NF): The table is in the second normal form, and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
