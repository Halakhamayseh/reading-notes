### CSS Grid
CSS Grid Layout is considered the most powerful layout system available in CSS
2-D system that can handle columns and rows
As opposed to flexbox, which is largely 1-D
 **Grid layout basics: Apply CSS rules both to a parent element (grid container) and to that element's children (grid items)**

**Flexbox and Grid work well together when combined**

Grid is specifically designed to solve longtime/common layout problems (and most browsers now natively support it)

 #### Grid
To start, you must define a container element with display: grid

1. Set column sizes with grid-template-columns
2. Set row sizes with grid-template-rows
Then place child elements into grid with grid-column and grid-row
Source order of grid items doesn't matter (similar to flexbox)

CSS can control their order, and rearranging grid items with media queries becomes super simple
#### Important Grid Terminology
1. Grid Container: The element on which display: grid is applied (direct parent of all grid items)

2. Grid Item: The children (direct descendants) of the grid container

3. Grid Line: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid

Can be vertical (column grid lines) or horizontal (row grid lines)
Grid Cell: The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines

A single unit of the grid
Grid Track: The space between two adjacent grid lines

Think of them like the columns/rows of grid
Grid Area: The total space surrounded by four grid lines

May be composed of any number of cells
The Most Powerful Lines in Grid
Fluid width columns can break into more or less columns as space is available - without the use of media queries:

### Grid Properties
Different properties for Parent elements (Grid Container) and Children (Grid Items)
## Regular Expressions (Regex)
Regular Expressions, known as Regex or Regexp, are tools used for extracting information from any text

Basically: A sequence of characters the define a search pattern
Search for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of characters)
Uses include:
Validation
Parsing/replacing strings (think 'find and replace')
Passing through translating data to other formats
