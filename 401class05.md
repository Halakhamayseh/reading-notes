# Read:Linked Lists 
### Types of Linked List.

In a linked list , there is only one reference , and that reference leads to the next node . There is a reference to both the Next and Previous node, which seems doubtful . It does not finish with a node pointing to a null value in a circular linked list . Instead of the traditional head node, it features a node that functions as the tail of the list , and the node following the tail node is the list's start .

### Terminology:

1. Linked List
2. Singly
3. Doubly
4. Node
5. Next
6. Head
7. Current
### Big O

Big O Notation is a method of evaluating an algorithm's performance . It's a means of expressing how long a function, operation, or algorithm takes to perform based on the number of elements we provide to it . An O(1) function runs in constant time, which means that no matter how huge our input is, our algorithm will always require the same amount of time and memory to run.
 
- time: O(n) (worse case) the node which has the value that searches for it is last

- space: O(1) This because there is no additional space being used

### Memory management
- The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines.
- When an array is created , it needs a certain amount of memory(all in one place ). On the other hand, when a linked list is born, it  doesnâ€™t need bytes of memory all in one place. One byte could live somewhere, while the next byte could be stored in another place in  memory altogether!
