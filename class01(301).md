# SMACSS and Responsive Web Design
#### based on quick growth for internet mobile usege ,so we need  to build websites suitable for all users. 
### Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size,the responsive web design term coined by Ethan.
### The difreents between Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
 * Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change and with responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width
 * Adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation and websites are built to a group of preset factors.
 * Mobile means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.

### Responsive web design is broken down into three main components(flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media)
### 1. Flexible Layouts: we need to building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width
   * Relative Viewport Lengths:we can use these viewport size units 
     * vw:Viewports width
     * vh:Viewports height
     * vmin:Minimum of the viewport’s height and width 
     * vmax:Maximum of the viewport’s height and width
##### **we need to adapt the change of width form device to another , so we can use Ethan formula (The formula is based around taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of it’s parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element.)**
   #####  Flexible Grid :Using the flexible grid formula we can take all of the fixed units of length and turn them into relative units,Taking the flexible layout concept, and formula, and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a completely dynamic website, scaling to every viewport size.
### 2. Media Queries:built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles and there different ways to use media queries()
* first way:using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet, importing a new style sheet using the @import rule ,recommend to use this way .
* second way: linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document.

**The media query expression that follows the media type may include different media features and values, which then allocate to be true or false. When a media feature and value allocate to true, the styles are applied. If the media feature and value allocate to false the styles are ignored.**

##### Logical Operators in Media Queries :Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions(and, not, and only.)
   1. and : Using the and logical operator within a media query allows an extra condition to be added,if you dont use and use Using Minimum & Maximum Prefixes
   2. not : The not logical operator negates the query, specifying any query but the one identified
   3. only:The only logical operator is a new operator and is not recognized by user agents using the HTML4 algorithm
##### Media Features in Media Queries:Media features identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression
##### Height & Width Media Features:Within responsive design the most commonly used features include min-width and max-width. These help build responsive websites on desktops and mobile devices equally, avoiding any confusion with device features.
##### Orientation Media Feature:The orientation media feature determines if a device is in the landscape or portrait orientation
##### Aspect Ratio Media Features:The aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio features specifies the width/height pixel ratio of the targeted rendering area or output device
##### Resolution Media Feature:The resolution media feature specifies the resolution of the output device in pixel density, also known as dots per inch or DPI.
##### Other Media Features:Other media features include identifying available output colors with use of the color, color-index, and monochrome features
##### Media Queries Demo:Using media queries we will now rewrite the flexible layout we built previously.
## Mobile First
   mobile first design is that a user on a mobile device, commonly using a smaller viewport, shouldn’t have to load the styles for a desktop computer also advocates designing with the constraints of a mobile user in mind
 ## Viewport
   Sometimes they could use a little assistance though, particularly around identifying the viewport size, scale, and resolution of a website.
   * Viewport Height & Width:Using the viewport meta tag with either the height or width values will define the height or width of the viewport respectively
   * Viewport Scale:To control how a website is scaled on a mobile device, and how users can continue to scale a website, use the minimum-scale, maximum-scale, initial-scale, and user-scalable properties.
   * Viewport Resolution:Letting the browser decide how to scale a website based off any viewport scale values usually does the trick.
   * Combining Viewport Values:The viewport meta tag will accept individual values as well as multiple values, allowing multiple viewport properties to be set at once.
### 3. Flexible Media
quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. Doing so ensures that as the viewport gets smaller any media will scale down according to its containers width.
   * Flexible Embedded Media:To get embedded media to be fully responsive, the embedded element needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element. The parent element needs to have a width of 100% so that it may scale based on the width of the viewport. The parent element also needs to have a height of 0 to trigger the hasLayout mechanism within Internet Explorer.
# Flaot
### What is Float?
Floats are also helpful for layout in smaller instances
#### Clearing the Float
An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.Clear has four valid values as well
* Both , which clears floats coming from either direction.
* Left and Right can be used to only clear the float from one direction respectively
* None: removing a clear value from a cascade
* inherit :Clearing only the left or right float,
### The Great Collapse
Collapsing almost always needs to be dealt with to prevent strange layout and cross-browser problems. We fix it by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.
### Techniques for Clearing Floats
  1. The Empty Div Method  `` <div style="clear: both;"></div>``
  2. The Overflow Method 
  3. The Easy Clearing Method
### Problems with Floats
 * Pushdown :is a symptom of an element inside a floated item being wider than the float itself
 * Double Margin Bug:Quick fix: set display: inline on the float.
 * The 3px Jog: Quick fix: set a width or height on the affected text.
 * In IE 7, the Bottom Margin Bug :Quick fix: using bottom padding on the parent instead.
### Alternatives
Faux Absolute Positioning, which is a very interesting technique that in many ways combines the flexibility of floats with the strength of absolute positioning. CSS3 has the Template Layout Module that, when widely adopted, will prove to be the page layout technique of choice.
## Don’t Overthink It Grids
### how i build grids?
* Context A block level element is as wide as the parent it’s inside (width: auto;)
* Columns To make them next to each other, we just need to float them and apply widths.
* Clearing Context The parent element will collapse to zero height since it has only floated children
* Gutters 
  * The first step using box-sizing: border-box;
  * The second step is applying a fixed padding to the right side of all columns except the last one.
* Outside Gutters
  * Step one is to add left padding to the grid parent (and optionally top and bottom padding)
  * Step two is to restore the right padding to the last column
## CSS Floats Explained By Riding An Escalator
Floats: Left and Right
Using floats can introduce up to two new flows: left and right,And this allows the normal flow of elements, those without a float value, to fill in the spaces around these elements.
#### The Clear Property
There is one more wrinkle that we have not discussed yet: the clear property. “Clear” allows elements to specify where they should align in comparison to the floated elements.
## SMACSS 
is more style guide than rigid framework mThere is no git repository for you to clone. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process.
