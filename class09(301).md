### Functional Programming Concepts
#### Complexity: "Anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify."
##### What is Functional Programming?
#### Functional Programming is a style of building structure/elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state/mutable data

#### Key Concepts of Functional Programming
### pure Functions
Pure Function: A pure function is when a function:

* Returns the same result if given the same arguments (deterministic)
* It does not cause any observable side-effects (like modifying a global object or parameter passed by reference)
* Benefits of pure functions:
  * Code is easier to test (more contexts)
### Functions CANNOT be pure if...

* If a function reads external files (file contents can change)
* If a function relies on a random number generator
  ## Reduce / .reduce()
     * .reduce() is a key way of making JS code more efficient:
      * Built in JS method
      * Reduce receives a function and a collection, and then returns a value by combining them

### Algorithm for solving the above with .reduce():

   * Filter by book type

   * Transform the shopping cart into a collection of amount using map

   * Combine all items by adding them up with reduce


### Refactoring Javascript for Readability
 * Good code = Finding the "middle ground" between speed and comprehension

We want our code to be efficient, but also human-readable and manintainable
* Strategies for Refactoring and Reducing Code
  * Return early from functions
  * Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
  * Check for Web APIs before implementing your own functionality

* Key Concepts
  * Keep in mind: There will always be edge cases - sooner or later something will break your code
  * It's often tough to go back and refactor code when working for a company - as once it's functioning, it becomes difficult to convince them changes are needed for the future
