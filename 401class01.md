## Variables

### The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables

- Instance Variables
- Class Variables
- Local Variables
- Parameters

## Operators:

1. postfix `expr++ expr--` |
1. unary `++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !`
1. multiplicative `\* / %`
1. additive `+ -`
1. shift `<< >> >>>`
1. relational `< > <= >= instanceof`
1. equality `== !=`
1. bitwise AND `&`
1. bitwise exclusive OR `^`
1. bitwise inclusive OR `|`
1. logical AND `&&`
1. logical OR `| |`
1. ternary `? :`
1. assignment `= += -= \*= /= %= &= ^= <<= >>=`
## Arrays: 
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.Each item in an array is called an element, which is accessed by its numerical index.
- **Declaring a Variable to Refer to an Array** Like declarations for variables of other types, an array declaration has two components: the array's type and the array's name. An array's type is written as type[], where type is the data type of the contained elements; the brackets are special symbols indicating that this variable holds an array.
- **Copying Arrays:** The System class has an arraycopy method that you can use to efficiently copy data from one array into another.
-  **Array Manipulations:** Java SE provides several methods for performing array manipulations (common tasks, such as copying, sorting and searching arrays) in the java.util.Arrays
## Expressions, Statements, and Blocks

Expressions are the basic components of statements, and statements may be combined into blocks. Operators can be used to create expressions that calculate values. This section uses previously viewed sample code to illustrate expressions, statements, and blocks.

An expression is a construct that evaluates to a single value and is made up of variables, operators, and method invocations that are built according to the syntax of the language. You've previously seen examples of phrases (shown in bold below), but now we'll show you how they're utilized in practice.

 Blocks a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
 
## ran a program called javadoc
To create the API documentation, the captains of Java ran a program called javadoc. The javadoc program took lines like these right out of the PrintStream.java file and used the lines to make the documentation that you see in your web browser.
