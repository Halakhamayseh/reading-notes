## Real time messaging with websockets

how to make a "Hello, world" program that sends messages back and forth between a browser and a server.
WebSocket is a thin, lightweight overlay that sits on top of TCP.

 This makes it possible to incorporate messages using "subprotocols.

" STOMP is a subprotocol that runs on top of WebSocket, which is a lower-level protocol. 
Create a server that can accept a message including a user's name.

 The server will respond by inserting a greeting into a queue to which the client has subscribed. 
Using Spring Initializer, start from the beginning. 

This guide's source repository may be downloaded and unzipped, or you can clone it using Git: git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-messaging-stomp-websocket.git. 

You may compare your findings to the code in gs-messaging-stomp-websocket/complete once you've finished.

## Process:

- server accepts a message that carries a user’s name. In response, the server will push a greeting into a queue to which the client is subscribed.

## Steps

- Spring Initializr
- Adding Dependencies
- Create a Resource Representation Class
- Create a Message-handling Controller
- Configure Spring for STOMP messaging
- Create a Browser Client
- Make the Application Executable

## Using WebSocket to build an interactive web application:

You need to add the following dependencies If you use Gradle:

```java
implementation 'org.webjars:webjars-locator-core'
implementation 'org.webjars:sockjs-client:1.0.2'
implementation 'org.webjars:stomp-websocket:2.3.3'
implementation 'org.webjars:bootstrap:3.3.7'
implementation 'org.webjars:jquery:3.1.1-1'
```

- Create a Message-handling Controller
  In Spring’s approach to working with STOMP messaging, STOMP messages can be routed to `@Controller` classes. For example, the GreetingController.


- This controller is concise and simple, but plenty is going on. We break it down step by step.

The `@MessageMapping` annotation ensures that, if a message is sent to the `/hello` destination, the `greeting()` method is called.

The payload of the message is bound to a HelloMessage object, which is passed into `greeting()`.

Internally, the implementation of the method simulates a processing delay by causing the thread to sleep for one second. This is to demonstrate that, after the client sends a message, the server can take as long as it needs to asynchronously process the message. The client can continue with whatever work it needs to do without waiting for the response.

After the one-second delay, the `greeting()` method creates a `Greeting` object and returns it. The return value is broadcast to all subscribers of` /topic/greetings`, as specified in the` @SendTo` annotation. Note that the name from the input message is sanitized, since, in this case, it will be echoed back and re-rendered in the browser DOM on the client side.

### Configure Spring for STOMP messaging

Now that the essential components of the service are created, you can configure Spring to enable WebSocket and STOMP messaging.



`WebSocketConfig` is annotated with `@Configuration` to indicate that it is a Spring configuration class. It is also annotated with `@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker`. As its name suggests, `@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker` enables WebSocket message handling, backed by a message broker.

The `configureMessageBroker()` method implements the default method in `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` to configure the message broker. It starts by calling `enableSimpleBroker()` to enable a simple memory-based message broker to carry the greeting messages back to the client on destinations prefixed with `/topic`. It also designates the `/app` prefix for messages that are bound for methods annotated with `@MessageMapping`. This prefix will be used to define all the message mappings. For example, `/app/hello` is the endpoint that the `GreetingController`.`greeting()` method is mapped to handle.

The registerStompEndpoints() method registers the /gs-guide-websocket endpoint, enabling SockJS fallback options so that alternate transports can be used if WebSocket is not available. The SockJS client will attempt to connect to /gs-guide-websocket and use the best available transport (websocket, xhr-streaming, xhr-polling, and so on).

## Test the service

- Now that the service is running, point your browser at http://localhost:8080 and click the Connect button.
- Upon opening a connection, you are asked for your name.
- Enter your name and click Send.
- Your name is sent to the server as a JSON message over STOMP.
- After a one-second simulated delay, the server sends a message back with a “Hello” greeting that is displayed on the page.
- At this point, you can send another name or you can click the Disconnect button to close the connection.
