## Call stack
### Call Stack: A mechanism for a code interpreter (like JavaScript in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions
#### Call stack also tracks:
1. What function is currently running
2. What functions are called from within that function
#### Basic functionality :
1. When a function is called in a script, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and begins carrying out that function
2. Any functions called by that function are adding to the call stack on top of the previous function, and run when the interpreter reaches their calls
3. When current function finishes, interpreter removes it from the top of the stack, and starts executing from wherever it left off in the previous function
#### Call stack operates on a Last In/First Out (LIFO) format
1. The code lower in the stack cannot be dealt with until the code above it in the stack is executed
2. The last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to come out when the function returns
#### Stack Overflow: An error that comes when a stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it

### Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
### Call Stack Key Concepts:
1. It's single-threaded - can only do one thing at a time

2. Code execution is synchronous

3. Function invocations create stack frames that occupy temporary memory

4. Works in a Last In/First Out (LIFO) data structure
### JavaScript Error Messages & Reference
#### Types of Error Messages:
1. Reference Errors: Occur when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared (or is stuck in the Temporal Dead Zone during hoisting)

2. Syntax Errors: Occur when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax (like using JSON.parse on an invalid object)

3. Range Errors: Occur when an object with length is manipulated and given an invalid length (like a negative length for an array)

4. Type Errors: Occur when the types (number, string, etc) you are trying to use or access are incompatible (like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable)
