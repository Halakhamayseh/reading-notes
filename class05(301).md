## HEROKU
### What Is Heroku?
**Heroku is a cloud application platform/hosting service that gives applications a place to "live" on the internet without worrying about technical infrastructure.**

Better than GitHub Pages when it comes to server-side ability, as Heroku handles server demands better than GitHub.

* Heroku is known as a cloud "platform as a service (PaaS)"
* Allows you to build/deploy your own web server 
* Heroku creates a random name for your application on startup
* All Heroku apps begin without branches or code

You will specify a remote branch to deploy to the first time
You can use Node.js with Heroku to build your server-side components of the application

### Node is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment
Allows you to write regular JavaScript on the backend.

#### View logs
Heroku treats logs as streams of time-ordered events aggregated from the output streams of all your app and Heroku components, providing a single channel for all of the events.
### Run the app locally
Now start your application locally using the heroku local command, which was installed as part of the Heroku CLI:

### Start a console
To get a real feel for how dynos work, you can create another one-off dyno and run the bash command, which opens up a shell on that dyno. You can then execute commands there. Each dyno has its own ephemeral filespace, populated with your app and its dependencies - once the command completes (in this case, bash), the dyno is removed.
### Define config vars
Heroku lets you externalize configuration - storing data such as encryption keys or external resource addresses in config vars.

At runtime, config vars are exposed as environment variables to the application. For example, modify index.js so that it introduces a new route, /times, that repeats an action depending on the value of the TIMES environment variable. Under the existing get() call, add another:
### Provision a database
The add-on marketplace has a large number of data stores, from Redis and MongoDB providers, to Postgres and MySQL. In this step, you will add a free Heroku Postgres Starter Tier dev database to your app.
