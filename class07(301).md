### REST
* REST = REpresentational State Transfer

* REST is an architecture used for the purpose of web APIs and data communication
* REST is the architectural style/basis for the entire world wide web:

 * Provides a definition of a resource - i.e., what a HTTPs "points" to
 * A web page is an example of a specific representation of a resource - most resources only have one representation, although in theory they could have multiple
 * Resources themselves are concepts (like URLs)
* REST supports the most common HTTP methods for interaction between applications and machines:

  GET: Retrieves a resource (returns records or data you feed in)
  PUT: Changes the state of or updates a resource (object, file)
  DELETE: Creates that resources
  POST: Removes that resource
  RESTful APIs (or REST APIs): Any web service that uses REST architecture
  Polymorphism: A programming/CS theory that different "nouns" (resources) can have the same "verb" (GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, etc) applied to them
