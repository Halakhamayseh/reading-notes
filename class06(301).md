## NODE.JS
### What Is Node.js?
**Node.js is a JavaScript runtime we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.**

* Important: Node.js lets us run JavaScript on the server (basically, allows you to write regular JavaScript on the back end)
* Node is event-driven, meaning anything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event (like a request, or an operation finishing)
* Built on Google Chrome's V8 engine

* I/O = input/output (the communication between a computer/processing system and the outside world/user)

### Installing Node.js
* npm - "Node Package Manager" is a package manager that comes bundled with Node

  * npm -v: Checks which version you have installed
* NPM is also the world's largest software registry
  More than one million packages of JavaScript code available for easy download
* Packages can be installed locally or globally:

** Global: npm install -g PACKAGE
** Local: npm init
* Creating a package.json file will allow you to indicate dependencies for a certain project (i.e., the packages a project needs to utilize/run)
    This allows any developer to clone the project and use npm to install whatever dependences/packages are needed to run it
### Using Node.js
* Node automates the process of developing a modern JavaScript application

* Any modern JavaScript framework (i.e. React, Angular, etc.) will need a working knowledge of Node and npm

  Reasoning: These frameworks and many related packages are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a dev environment to run in
### Node.js Execution Model
* Node is single-threaded - making it more efficient (traditional servers spawn multiple threads for new requests, which can cause them to become sluggish or crash)

* Node's execution model causes much less overhead to a server and can therefore handle a large number of simultaneous connections

   Approach to scaling: Clone Node and have the cloned instances share the workload
### Advantages of Node.js
* Node is well-suited for applications that require real-time interaction or collaboration

  i.e.: Chat sites, live document editing, APIs receiving lots of request (like database operations), data streaming
* Node makes it possible to process files while they're still being uploaded

* Node has a significant "real-time aspect"

* Great speed and scalability,

* Ability to use JavaScript on the server side - no translation necessary

  Everything can be done in the same language and code can easily be shared between server/client
* Node speaks in "JSON" - data can easily flow between layers without reformatting (one syntax all the way through the browser-server-database cycle)

* Excellent support for modern JavaScript (ES6) and beyond - don't have to worry about browser compatibility/breaking code between browsers

### Downsides of Node.js
* Node does not handle CPU-intensive operations well - these should be handed off to a "worker thread"

   Overloads can crash the entire process
* Asynchronous coding in JavaScript can be tricky (lots of callbacks)
