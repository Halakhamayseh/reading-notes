# Read: 27 - Intents, Activities, and SharedPreferences
## Understand Tasks and Back Stack
### Tasks:

- It is a collection of metadata and information around a stack of activities.

- The activities are arranged in a stack—the back stack—in the order in which each activity is opened.

- "last in, first out" stack.

- startActivity():pushing a new activity onto your task causing stop or pause the previous activity if exists.

- finish():it pops the stack,removing activity from the back stack and moving to the previous stak.


### The default behavior for activities and tasks:

- When Activity A starts Activity B, Activity A is stopped, but the system retains its state (such as scroll position and text entered into forms). If the user presses the Back button while in Activity B, Activity A resumes with its state restored.

- When the user leaves a task by pressing the Home button, the current activity is stopped and its task goes into the background. The system retains the state of every activity in the task. If the user later resumes the task by selecting the launcher icon that began the task, the task comes to the foreground and resumes the activity at the top of the stack.

- If the user presses the Back button, the current activity is popped from the stack and destroyed. The previous activity in the stack is resumed. When an activity is destroyed, the system does not retain the activity's state.

- Activities can be instantiated multiple times, even from other tasks.

### In this regard, the principal `<activity>` **attributes** you can use are:

1. taskAffinity
2. launchMode
3. allowTaskReparenting
4. clearTaskOnLaunch
5. alwaysRetainTaskState
6. finishOnTaskLaunch

### And the principal intent flags you can use are:

- FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
- FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP
- FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP


### Defining launch modes

Launch modes allow you to define how a new instance of an activity is associated with the current task. You can define different launch modes in two ways:

1. Using the manifest file
2. Using Intent flags

The launchMode attribute specifies an instruction on how the activity should be launched into a task. There are `four` different launch modes you can assign to the launchMode attribute:

1. "standard" (the default mode)
2. "singleTop"
3. "singleTask"
4. "singleInstance"

### Starting a task

You can set up an activity as the entry point for a task by giving it an intent filter with "android.intent.action.MAIN" as the specified action and "android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" as the specified category. For example:

```xml
<activity ... >
    <intent-filter ... >
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
    ...
</activity>
```

### Save key-value data

If you have a relatively small collection of key-values that you'd like to save, you should use the SharedPreferences APIs. A SharedPreferences object points to a file containing key-value pairs and provides simple methods to read and write them. Each SharedPreferences file is managed by the framework and can be private or shared.

```
Context context = getActivity();
SharedPreferences sharedPref = context.getSharedPreferences(
        getString(R.string.preference_file_key), Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
```



```
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
```

If you're using the SharedPreferences API to save app settings, you should instead use getDefaultSharedPreferences() to get the default shared preference file for your entire app. For more information, see the Settings developer guide.

```
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPref.edit();
editor.putInt(getString(R.string.saved_high_score_key), newHighScore);
editor.apply();
```


- Read from shared preferences

```
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
int defaultValue = getResources().getInteger(R.integer.saved_high_score_default_key);
int highScore = sharedPref.getInt(getString(R.string.saved_high_score_key), defaultValue);
```
