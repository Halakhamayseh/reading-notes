# Read: 13 - Related Resources and Integration Testing

### Working with Relationships in Spring Data REST:

## One-to-One Relationship
- it defines using the @OneToOne annotation
1. The Data Model
2. The Repositories
3. Creating the Resources
4. Creating the Associations

## One-to-Many Relationship

- Defined using the @OneToMany, and @ManyToOne annotations
- can have the optional @RestResource annotation to customize the association resource.
1. The Data Model
2. The Repositories
3. The Association Resources

## Many-to-Many Relationship

- Defined using @ManyToMany annotation.
1. The Data Model
2. The Repository
3. The Association Resources

- Let's create a repository interface to manage the Author entity:

  ```java
    public interface AuthorRepository extends CrudRepository<Author, Long> {

    }
  ```
## Testing the Endpoints With TestRestTemplate
1. Testing the One-to-One Relationship
- @Test method that saves Library and Address objects by making POST requests to the collection resources.
2. Testing the One-to-Many Relationship
- @Test method that saves a Library instance and two Book instances,  sends a PUT request to each Book object's
3. Testing the Many-to-Many Relationship
For testing the many-to-many relationship between Book and Author entities, we will create a test method that saves one Author record and two Book records.
