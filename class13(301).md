### Sending Form Data
### METHODS
#### GET: The GET method is used by the browser to ask a server to send back a resource

* Browser sends an empty body, which means the data from a form will be appended to the URL in the server
#### POST: The POST method is the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response

* This method takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request
* If a form is sent with this method, the data is appended to the HTTP request body
#### Data must be retrieved on the server side - different methods depend on the development platform:

* PHP
* Python
* Node.js
* Ruby
#### Frameworks for the above technologies make handling forms easier:

* Laravel (PHP)
* Django (Python)
* Express (Node.js)
* Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
#### Security Issues
* "Be paranoid: Never trust your users"

* All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized every single time with no exceptions:

  * Escape potentially dangerous characters (like executable code in JS or SQL commands)
  * Limit incoming amount of data to what's necessary
  * Sandbox uploaded files (store them on a different server and control access through a different domain/subdomain)
* Sending form data is easy - securing an application is tougher

  * Front-end developers should not define the security model of data
  * Client-side form validation is possible, but servers cannot/should not trust that validation (no way to verify)
